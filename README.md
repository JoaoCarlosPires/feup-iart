## Project

The project consists on a text-based computer version of the board game [Tak](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/197405/tak "Tak").

The programming language used was C++.

## Compile, Run and Use

- To compile and run, you can use any C++ compatible IDE (we've used [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/ "CLion")) or compiler. The code doesn't have any external dependencies.

- To run, the main.cpp file should be invoked.

- To play the game, just follow the instructions on the screen, which are pretty intuitive.
